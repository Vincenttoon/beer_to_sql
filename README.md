Backend Untappd mock featuring my personal list of beers tasted.

ToDo:

Create and implement option to update beer rating by name

Create Menus for More Add, More View, and Deletions:
Potentially Make these all one list: {

   // More View - 
        - Create following files in both data and main index:
        - See All Breweries (Name, City, State)
        - See All Styles (Name)
        - See All Ratings (ID, Value)
        - Include Add's


   // More Add -
        - Move Add Brewery, Add Style into file
        - Create Add Style in data and main index, test, and implement in this list
        - Direction back to main menu
        - Quit options
        - Include Views

}

Create Deletions -
_ Move Delete Beer, Delete Brewery into file
_ Create Delete Style in data and main index, test, and implement in this list
_ Direction back to main menu
_ Quit Option




BUG 1 - After adding a brewery through Add beer, prompt repeats. If user says no, brewery not added
