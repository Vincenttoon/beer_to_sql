Backend Untappd mock featuring my personal list of beers tasted.

ToDo:

Create and implement option to update beer rating by name

Create Menus for More Add, More View, and Deletions:

More Add - 
    * Move Add Brewery, Add Style into file
    * Create Add Style in data and main index, test, and implement in this list
    * Direction back to main menu
    * Quit option

More View -
    * Create following files in both data and main index:
        ** See All Breweries (Name, City, State)
        ** See All Styles (Name)
        ** See All Ratings (ID, Value)

Create Deletions - 
    * Move Delete Beer, Delete Brewery into file
    * Create Delete Style in data and main index, test, and implement in this list
    * Direction back to main menu
    * Quit Option



BUG 1 - After adding a brewery through Add beer, prompt repeats. If user says no, brewery not added
